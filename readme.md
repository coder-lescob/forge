# *Forge* - The steel compiler

This is the current version (0.1.5) of **forge - the steel compiler**. Not finished yet.

## what's **Steel**

Steel is my programming language that I created in 2025, not a **Rust** compiler, my compiler which means that it has to be better
than **Rust** (because **Rust** complicates things too much for nothing unlike **C** which is simpler). Anyway **Steel** uses the 
**C abi** which means that it uses the same way than **C** to communicates between functions and store data, so it is compatible with 
any software that is compatible with **C**, which is most of the software of the world. Even if I'm not a big fan of **Rust** I borrowed 
from it its major pro which is that it is safe in term of memory, but unlike **Rust**, instead of using references or wierd living time 
variables that I don't understand **Steel** uses pointers that are made safes by a lot of compiler checks (not garenty yet that it was 
correctly implemented).

### Safty features

In **Steel** a function can be flaged to return a pointer that should be freed and the compiler will detect when it is the best moment to free it
(the sooner after beeing used last) which avoid memory leaks, checks are also performs to avoid buffer overflows at run time if the size or the index 
cannot be known at compile time and at compile time when it can, if some programmer tries to put a value bigger than the variable used for storage
the compiler will truncanate to the right size and throw a warning to this programmer, if a negative value is trying to be put in an unsigned variable
the compiler will throw an error to the not careful programmer and finally the usage of multiple sized variable in a calcul is totally valid as long as
the size of the bigger variable is less than or equal to the size of the variable used for storage.

## My old C++ version

**Steel** is a language that I created in 2025, with my first version in C++, but the project came to a dead end when 
I wasn't to implement nicely comments, the other reson of why I have abandoned the C++ version is that I wanted to do 
it in C to challenge myself, also the parser algorithm wasn't optimal and I wanted to invent a new one.
