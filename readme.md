### *Forge* - The steel compiler

This is the current version (0.0.0.1) of *forge the steel compiler*. 

## The old C++ version

*Steel* is a language that I created in 2025, with my first version in C++, but the project came to a dead end when 
I wasn't to implement nicely comments, the other reson of why I have abandoned the C++ version is that I wanted to do 
it in C to challenge myself, also the parser algorithm wasn't optimal and I wanted to invent a new one.
