# *Forge* - The steel compiler

This is the current version (0.2.0) of **forge - the steel compiler**. Not finished yet.

## what's **Steel**

### overview

*Steel* is my programming language that I created in 2025. *Steel* uses the C abi which means that it uses the same way than *C* to communicates between functions and store data, so it is compatible with any software that is compatible with *C*, which is most of the software of the world. Even if I'm not a big fan of *Rust* I borrowed from it its major pro which is that it is safe in term of memory, but unlike *Rust*, instead of using references or wierd living time variables that I don't understand *Steel* uses pointers that are made safes by a lot of compiler checks (not garenty yet that it was correctly implemented).

### why I created it

I created *the Steel programming language* because I find that *Rust* syntax is too rusty. So I want to create an option for the *C dinosaurs* like me, that is **safe in terms of memory**. If you like *Rust* no problem use it, if you love *C* you can use *Steel* to prevent **memory vulnerabilities**. *Steel* is not created to replace *C* but to provide a **memory safe** alternative to *Rust* for whose love the *C way of programming*.

### Safty features

In *Steel* a function can be flaged to return a pointer that should be freed and the compiler will detect when it is the best moment to free it (the sooner after beeing used last) which avoid **memory leaks**, checks are also performs to avoid **buffer overflows** at *run time* if the size or the index cannot be known at *compile time* and at *compile time* when it can, if some programmer tries to put a *value bigger* than the variable used for storage the compiler will *truncanate* to the *right size* and *throw a warning* to this programmer, if a *negative* value is trying to be put in an *unsigned variable* the compiler will *throw an error* to the not careful programmer and finally the usage of *multiple sized* variable in a *calcul* is totally **valid** as long as the size of the bigger variable is less than or equal to the size of **the variable used for storage**.

## why Steel ?

In metallurgy **Steel** is an alloy of **iron** and **carbon**. The **carbon** is really lite, like *C* is for programmers, while **iron** *rusts* in contact with **oxygene**. So *Steel* is an alloy, a mix, between *C* and *Rust*. Even if its name should be *inoxydable steel* to be accurate.

## My old C++ version

*Steel* is a language that I created in 2025, with my first version in *C++*, but the project came to a dead end when I wasn't able to implement nicely comments, the other reson of why I have abandoned the *C++* version is that I wanted to do it in *C* to challenge myself, also the **parser algorithm** wasn't optimal and I wanted to invent a new one.
